      The goal of our project was to create a website that allows both students and teachers to give feedback to presentations of their colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>Teachers can create their own accounts and add students to groups. After creating a presentation, the students enter a code, to get access to the feedback form. Both, teachers and students will have to fill out the same form, first for the whole group of the presentation and afterwards they can give additional feedback to individuals of the group. The results are then displayed on a different webpage, whereas the left side shows the feedback given by students and the right side the ones given by teachers.
      Everything will happen anonymously.
      </p>
      <p>When feedback was given to an individual person, this person receives an email with a link that sends them back to our website, where they can view their feedback.
      </p>
      <p>And here you can see, where the most of the project was created</p>
